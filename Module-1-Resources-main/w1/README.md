  * Craft a clear, concise coding question to a more experienced developer.
  * Research unknown JavaScript code syntax using MDN.
  * Identify and fix a bug in code based on an error message.
  * Manage your time and stress at App Academy.
* Expressions
  * Given a working REPL interface, write and execute a statement that will print “hello world” using `console.log`.
  * Identify that strings are a list of characters defined by using double or single quotes.
  * Given an arithmetic expression using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, compute its value.
  * Given an expression, predict if its value is `NaN`.
  * Construct the truth tables for `&&`, `||`, `!`.
  * Given an expression consisting of `>`, `>=`, `===`, `<`, `<=`, compute it’s value.
  * Apply De Morgan’s law to a boolean expression.
  * Given an expression that utilizes operator precedence, compute its value.
  * Given an expression, use the grouping operator to change it’s evaluation.
  * Given expressions using `==` and `===`, compute their values.
  * Given a code snippet using postfix `++`, postfix `--`, `+=`, `-=`, `/=`, `*=`, predict the value of labeled lines.
  * Create and assign a variable using let to a string, integer, and a boolean. Read its value and print to the console.
* Strings
  * Describe the properties of a string.
  * Create a string.
  * Find the length of a string.
  * Find the character at a certain index in a string.
  * Concatenate two strings together.
  * Find the first instance of a character in a string.
  * Create a new string from a sub-section of a given string.
* Arrays
  * Describe the properties of an array.
  * Create an array.
  * Find the length of an array.
  * Find *or change* the element at a certain index in an array.
  * Concatenate two arrays together.
  * Find the first instance of an element in an array.
  * Create a new array from a sub-section of a given array.
* Intro Functions
  * Define a function using function declaration.
  * Define a function that calculates the average of two numbers, call it, pass in arguments, and print its return value.
  * Identify the difference between parameters vs arguments.
  * Define and use a helper function to solve a function's sub-problem.
* Advanced Functions
  * Identify that strings are immutable and arrays are mutable.
  * Define a function using both function declaration and function expression syntax.
  * Utilize `Array.push`, `.pop`, `.shift`, `.unshift` to mutate an array.
  * List the arguments that can be used with `Array.splice`.
  * Write a function that sums up elements of an array, given an array of numbers as an argument.
  * Define a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the primes.
  * Define a function that takes in a 2D array of numbers and returns the total sum of all elements in the array.
  * Define a function that takes in an array of elements and returns a 2d array where the subarrays represent unique pairs of elements.
  * Define a function that takes in an array of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest value in the array; if the array is empty return `null`.
* Control Flow
  * Define a function that accepts a sentence string and two words as args. The function should return a boolean indicating if the sentence includes either word.
  * Identify a pair of mutually exclusive conditions.
  * Given a for loop, translate it into a while loop, and vice-versa.
  * Write a function that iterates through a provided string argument.
  * Write a function that takes in an array of words and a string as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is located inside of the array. The function must use Array's `indexOf` method.
  * Define that an array literal is an ordered list of values defined by using bracket and individual values are read by indexing.
