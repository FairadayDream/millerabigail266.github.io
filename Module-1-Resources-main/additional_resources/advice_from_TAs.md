# What Makes a Student Successful?

- Block the time: Start the day at 8am and finish at 5pm plus 1-2 hours of \
  homework Monday through Friday. Most students put in 4 to 8 hours during \
  the weekend as well.
- Get the basics covered: Sleep, nutrition and exercise. Strive to get 8 hours \
  of sleep per night, eat nutrient dense foods, do some form of exercise daily \
  (we suggest walking outside).
- Take your breaks. Don't work through lunch and afternoon break. \
  Once you are done with your homework, do something to distract you and stop \
  thinking about code.
- Set alarms for your 3 check-ins and nightly report. We take strikes very \
  seriously.
- After you finish going through a video or reading, take a moment and try to \
  state what you remember from the video/reading. It'll go a long way.
- Looking at a solution and thinking that you know how to arrive at that \
  solution is a common illusion of competence in learning. Don't look at \
  solutions!
- We will provide learning objectives and a practice assessment before every \
  assessment. Fill out the learning objectives and take the practice assessment \
  as many times as you need to until it feels easy.
- Every day builds on top of the last in terms of technical concepts, so it’s \
  very important that you understand each day’s material as you go. Don’t leave \
  things for later. Call us over for questions a lot. As a rule of thumb, there \
  shouldn’t be a single line of code in your projects that you’re not \
  comfortable with. As soon as that happens, talk about it with your pair or \
  call us over.
