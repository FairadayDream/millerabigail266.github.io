# Advice from Students

## Pro tips

- Anticipate 60 - 80hrs weeks especially later on in the course
- Prepare for all day weekend work, especially later on in the course
- Type out code during pre-recorded videos, lectures, and readings to turn \
  passive learning into active learning
- Get organized sooner vs later. Maybe make a folder on your computer \
  for each week.
- Maybe don't take constant notes, since this may not be long-term sustainable \
  later on or as helpful as active learning methods
- Make check-in notifications on your computer vs just your phone
- It's likely better to get through all of the readings with a bigger picture \
  understanding say ~70-80% than to only have read 1/4 of the reading \
  but learned every detail and understood that 1/4 really well \
  Move on if stuck on a small part and return to later. \
  The same can be applied to the exercise problems.
- Form study groups, they'll likely happen organically.
- If you already know the material and don't need to study, consider still \
  attending study groups. Explaining the concepts to others in our cohort will \
  help you retain it longer and faster, and is also good networking. You never \
  know where someone may end up working.
- On a daily basis, remember that as the program's materials get more \
  complicated, sometimes the readings or lectures may look "alien" and this \
  is a normal experience. Get to the point where it no longer seems "alien" \
  that day. It's likely okay if at that point you're not able to understand \
  everything 100% or retain it all, because the same concepts will likely \
  reappear a few times that week. As long as you can go from \
  "this is all alien" to "okay, I can follow this, but X details are a bit \
  fuzzy" that's good! Major concepts will reappear, build off each other, \
  and you can review in a few hours or the next day or on weekends. \
  Keep the momentum going.
- During really intense weeks, TAs or instructors *may* offer remote \
  "office hours" which can be helpful, but isn't necessarily something to rely \
  on or a frequent resource that happens guaranteed. More of a side note to \
  keep in back of mind. Resources to rely on would be \
  open.appacademy.io, study groups, your cohort MDN etc.
- As the course goes on, there likely will be too many exercise problems \
  to solve, to complete daily during time constraints. We're not graded on \
  our completion of the readings, exercises, or pre-recorded lecture videos \
  watched on open.appacademy.io. These are for us to use to see what works \
  best for us when getting to the point of mastering materials and passing \
  assessments. Active "difficult" learn as much as you can, learn by doing.
- Consider meal prepping for weekdays during weekends.

## Assessments

- Retake practice assessments multiple times
- Time yourself while taking practice assessments
- Use daily learning objectives from that week for multi-choice pre
