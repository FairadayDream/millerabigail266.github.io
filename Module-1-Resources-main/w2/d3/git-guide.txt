Quick Git Guide

Mac Users - should be able to download directly

Window Users - Downloading a zipped folder via Ubuntu

- Open up your Ubuntu and run these 2 commands.
	- sudo apt install zip
	- sudo apt-get install wget
- Head over to the GitHub project repo that you want to download.
- Click the green dropdown box labeled "<> Code"
- Look for "Download ZIP" and RIGHT click it. Then select "Copy link address"
- Head back over to your Ubuntu terminal and type the following command "wget" then paste
  the link address after it. It should look something like this "wget linkAddress".
Now that you have the zip folder downloaded, unzip it!
- Use the "ls" command to see your directories contents. You should see a new zipped folder.
- Type "unzip folderName.zip" to unzip its contents.
- Use the "ls" command again to see your new project folder.
- You can now delete the .zip folder by using the command "rm -rf folderName.zip" now that everything
  is unpacked.

Person Creating the Repo

Quick way to create a repo!
- git clone <a/A repo url>
- cd <folder name>
- git remote set-url origin <your repo url>
- git push

Can do this two ways - download vs clone the project
	- easier to download!!

If you git clone
if you git clone - there will be a slightly different process

If you clone you can use rm -rf to delete the .git then follow the normal steps to initialize a repo

or set the url origin to a new link
1. git remote set-url origin [github link]
2. git add .
3. git commit -m 'first'
4. git push

Download the project!
1. download the zip, in a location you would like
2. unzip the file
3. cd into the file

After downloading/cloning start here!

Creating the repo
1. click create new repo on github
2. select owner, give repo name
3. make repo private
4. click create repo

Adding the files to the repo
1. ls
2. git init
3. git add .
4. git commit -m 'first commit'
5. git branch -M main
6. git remote add origin [github link]
7. git push -u origin main

Add .gitignore
	1. after npm i
	2. create .gitignore
	3. add node_modules to .gitgnore
	4. git add .
	5. git commit -m 'added gitignore'
	6. git push

Invite Collaborator
	1. go to settings
	2. collaborators
	3. add people - enter partners name

Partner
	1. then goes to email
	2. accept invitation
	3. git clone the repo

Git flow
	Anytime you add something to the repo
		- you must git add .
		- git commit -m 'message'
	        - git push

	If you want your partners changes you use
		- git pull

	Do no work on the files at the same time without pulling or you will end up with a git conflict

To git rid of staged changes
git reset --hard && git pull
git stash

* If you happen to commit the node_modules directory to your history before adding the .gitignore file, then we can do this to remove it from our commit history:
    * run git rm -r --cached node_modules
    * add .gitignore file with node_modules in it like the example above if you haven't yet
    * run git add .
    * run git commit -m "message here"
    * run git push
