# Week 2 Additional Resources

## Learning Objectives

* Objects
  * Label variables as either Primitive vs. Reference.
  * Identify when to use dot notation (`.`) vs. bracket notation (`[]`) when \
  accessing values of an object.
  * Use the `obj[key] !== undefined` pattern to check if a given variable that \
  contains a key exists in an object.
  * Utilize `Object.keys` and `Object.values` in a function.
  * Iterate through an object using a `for...in` loop.
  * Define a function that utilizes `...rest` syntax to accept an arbitrary \
  number of arguments.
  * Use `...spread` syntax for Object literals and Array literals.
  * Destructure an array to reference specific elements.
  * Destructure an object to reference specific values.
  * Write a function that accepts an array as an argument and returns an object \
  representing the count of each character in the array.
* Callbacks
  * Given multiple plausible reasons, identify why functions are called \
  “First Class Objects” in JavaScript.
  * Given a code snippet containing an anonymous callback, a named callback, \
  and multiple `console.log`s, predict what will be printed.
  * Write a function that takes in a value and two callbacks. The function \
  should return the result of the callback that is greater.
  * Write a function, myMap, that takes in an array and a callback as arguments.\
   The function should mimic the behavior of `Array.map`.
  * Write a function, myFilter, that takes in an array and a callback as \
  arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array.filter`.
  * Write a function, myEvery, that takes in an array and a callback as \
  arguments. The function should mimic the behavior of `Array.every`.
* Scope
  * Identify the difference between const, let, and var declarations.
  * Explain the difference between const, let, and var declarations.
  * Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, \
  lexical scope, and scope chaining.
  * Define an arrow function.
  * Implement a closure and explain how the closure effects scope.
