# Sprint 1 Mid-Week Skills Check - Helper Functions

The purpose of this skill check is to gauge your current level of skill and
understanding of Sprint 1 content. Based on the results of this skill check,
your instructors will be able to help provide more targeted support so you are
ready for the assessment in a few days.

This problem may feel challenging, and that is OK. You will need to use Polya's
problem solving framework to understand the problem, make a plan, carry out the
plan, and look back and improve your solution.

If you pass all of the test specs, then you are in a great place moving through
this sprint! If you do not pass all of the tests, your instructors will use the
results of the skill check to target specific areas to get you ready for the
assessment at the end of the sprint.

## Setup

1. Download and unzip the skeleton from the link
2. Rename the folder to `firstname-lastname-sprint-1-skill-check`. For
   example, if your name is "Jane Doe", then name your folder
   `jane-doe-sprint-1-skill-check`
3. In the terminal, `cd` into the project folder and run `npm install`
   to install dependencies


As you are working on the problems, you can run the local test cases for
debugging purposes by running the following command:

`node /problems/encoder.js`

The local test cases are provided to you at the bottom of the
__/problems/encoder.js__ file. Un-comment ONLY ONE test case at a time before
running the file.

Run `npm test` to run all test specs.

**Important Note** _If environment or tech setup issues are preventing you from
accessing, completing, or submitting this skill check, you may complete a REPL
version of the task. An instructor will reach out to you after the skill check
to help address your specific environment or workflow issues._

## Working through the problem(s)

Keep in mind the following tips as you work through the problem(s):

- Work through the problem(s) in order
- The tasks get harder as you move through the problems
- The goal IS NOT to achieve 100% of the points
- The goal IS to get as far as you can in 30 minutes - partial credit will help
  your instructors to help you
- Use documentation resources, such as [MDN], to look up any methods or syntax to
  help you solve the problems
- If you struggle, share where you got stuck on your daily report - this will
  also help your instructors plan extra support for you

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Re-run all unit tests and fix any syntax errors that are crashing the tests.
If the unit tests crash, or do not run, you will not receive any points on the
skill check
2. **Delete the `node_modules` directory**
3. Zip up your folder
4. Upload it
